    question: "What are Shaker Style Cabinets?",
    answer1:
      "Shaker style cabinets are units that are uniquely simple yet attractive. They feature recessed panel doors, light finishes and basic hardware.",
    answer2:
      "Shaker style cabinets mirror the furniture designed by the Shakers, who were extremely skilled craftsmen and carpenters. Shaker style cabinets have doors with recessed panels and minimal adornments. Many Shaker cabinets are built using hardwood, although some may use veneer panels in the doors. The style is complemented with natural finishes or light stains. Shaker style cabinets may even be painted with a distressed finish to give the units an appearance of age that enhances the styleâ€™s beauty and appeal. Due to the simplicity of the design, hardware is usually hidden. Wooden knobs or handles are ideal for Shaker style cabinets because they complement the simple features. In many cases, Mission cabinets are labeled as Shaker style cabinets. However, many Mission style cabinets feature arches and designs that are not true to the Shaker style, so the names are not necessarily interchangeable.",

    question: "What is a Recessed Panel Door?",
    answer1:
      "A recessed panel door is a cabinet door with a center panel that is slightly depressed. Recessed panel doors often include thinner wood than other types of cabinet doors.",
    answer2:
      "A recess panel door has a center panel that is slightly lower than the surrounding door frame. The panels are often made of alternative materials because they need to be thinner than the rest of the door. These doors are often built using solid wood, but the panels are veneer. This allows the material to be thin enough to sit inside the recessed area without changing the finished appearance of the wood. Recessed panel doors are available in many styles and finishes. They may incorporate arches or square angles, and glass or metal are sometimes used in place of wooden panels. Many recessed panel doors feature beveled trim that adds a touch of elegance to the door. Matching drawer fronts are often available so that all of the cabinet units have the same design.",
